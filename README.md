# Modern JS Boilerplate

This is a dead simple, modern web development setup.

My goal was to:
- Implement compling and polyfills to get the latest and greatest JS features
- Use a dev server that restarts when a change to the code base is saved
- Add SASS

That's about it. 

Clone it, run `npm install`, and run `npm start` to start it on `http://localhost:8080/`.
